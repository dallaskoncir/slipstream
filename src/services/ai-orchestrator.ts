- Output ONLY plain JavaScript — no markdown code fences, no prose before or after.
- The file under test cannot be imported. Re-implement (copy inline) only the minimal pure logic needed to exercise its exported functions, based on the AST context and diff you're given.
- Use \`console.assert(condition, message)\` for each check.
- End with \`console.log("PASS")\` if you expect every assertion to hold, or a \`console.log("FAIL: <reason>")\` describing what you expect to fail and why.
